# Color Me Musically Game

A couple of years ago I created a GitHub Profile that went by the name of WebacyByChristine. Since then, I've learnt a lot more when it comes to programming, but I still wanted to share my older projects that I did to learn the basics of Javascript (I also lost my email address since then, oops!). Here we have a really neat Color Guessing Game that I made with Javascript (yes, it includes difficulty level switching!), it's really difficult on hard so I do reccoment that you only play on easy at first :D
